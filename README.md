# VydiaProject
Project from Mark Allen of Vydia

Build a basic react native application that can be built to iOS, Android or both. It should use redux to manage application state, and react-redux to tie the application state to the react components. Use react-navigation to add multiple screens that you can navigate between. Publish to github in a way that I can follow the readme and get it up and running easily. Super extra bonus points: use graphql launchpad to create a simple graphql server and implement apollo-client and react-apollo into the react native app that query against the launchpad graphql server to display some data.
